Description: beeply
        ======
        
        A python package that helps you produce musical notes using your
        computer's characteristic beep sounds. Written in Python.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        ``winsound`` python package is required. This package is present by
        default, if you use python on windows. Due to this dependency, 
        ``beeply-win`` will ONLY work on windows platforms.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pip install beeply``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        -  Import beeply in your python code as ``from beeply import notes``.
        -  Create an object of a class "beeps" as ``mybeep = notes.beeps()``.
           You can also set the default time period (in milliseconds) for which
           the note plays by passing it as an argument during object creation
           like ``mybeep = notes.beeps(400)``. If you do not specify anything,
           it takes a default value of 900ms.
        -  Use this object to hear the musical notes. For example -
           ``mybeep.hear('C')``. You can also play a certain note for a time
           period other than the default period by specifying it in the
           arguments like ``mybeep.hear('C',2000)`` [Plays the C note for 2
           seconds].
        
        You can use C, D, E... for notes in the middle scale i.e. Scale 0 while
        adding a ``_`` after the note raises it to the next scale i.e. Scale 1.
        For example, using ``mybeep.hear('C_')`` will produce the C note in the
        Scale 1.
